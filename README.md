# Oblasti UA

[Українська](https://github.com/artem-y/oblasti_ua/blob/master/README.uk.md) | [Русский](https://github.com/artem-y/oblasti_ua/blob/master/README.ru.md)  
**Oblasti UA** (*Regions UA*, ukr.: *"Області UA"*) is an educational game for iOS.  
How well do you know the geography of Ukraine? Try to find where regions are located on the symbolic game map or learn it using *Pointer* mode!

## How To Play
The game is very simple - it is basically just guessing where the regions are on the map. 
Randomly selected region name appears on the screen, and the player has to find the corresponding region by tapping on one of the shapes from the symbolic map.
Then the game will tell the player if the guess was correct or wrong by showing animation, playing sound and highlighting the region with green (for correct answer) or red (for wrong answer).
It can also show where the correct region was, if the player missed it.  
Above is the default behaviour, but many parts of gaming process are customizable. For example, you can choose not to confirm the selected region automatically. 
If done so, the choice will not be immediately confirmed, and the player has to do it manually. It gives an opportunity to correct the selection after accidentally mistapping on the wrong region.  
And, of course, there is an option of turning on/off sound effects and animated buttons which fly out onto the screen to notify the player about what's going on.

## Modes
Currently, game supports three modes:  

1. *Classic*: In this mode game finishes only after all the regions are found. The regions that have already appeared but were not guessed correctly, will keep randomly appearing until the player finds them. 
2. *No Repetitions*: Each region will only be shown once, no matter if guessed right or wrong. The game will finish after all of the regions were shown once.
3. *Pointer*: This, actually, is not a "game" mode. User doesn't have to guess regions. When any of the regions is tapped, it will just show the name of selected region. This mode is designed for learning the names, but it can also be used for presentations in classrooms, as a good and interactive way of showing some information (especially if combined with the feature of custom region names).

## Localizations
The app's interface has *English*, *Russian* and *Ukrainian* localizations, but there are more languages that user can choose for the names of the regions. 
In addition to the above languages, region names can also be displayed in *Spanish* and *Chinese (Mandarin)*.  
There is also an option of adding custom region names, which can be used as an extra localization.
