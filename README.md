# Oblasti UA

[Українська](https://github.com/artem-y/oblasti_ua/blob/master/README.uk.md) | [Русский](https://github.com/artem-y/oblasti_ua/blob/master/README.ru.md)  
**Oblasti UA** (*Regions UA*, ukr.: *"Області UA"*) is an educational game for iOS.  
How well do you know the geography of Ukraine? Try to find where regions are located on the symbolic game map or learn it using *Pointer* mode!

## Modes
Currently, game supports three modes:  

1. *Classic*: In this mode game finishes only after all the regions are found. The regions that have already appeared but were not guessed correctly, will keep randomly appearing until the player finds them. 
2. *No Repetitions*: Each region will only be shown once, no matter if guessed right or wrong. The game will finish after all of the regions were shown once.
3. *Pointer*: This, actually, is not a "game" mode. User doesn't have to guess regions. When any of the regions is tapped, it will just show the name of selected region. This mode is designed for learning the names, but it can also be used for presentations in classrooms, as a good and interactive way of showing some information (especially if combined with the feature of custom region names).

## Localizations
The app's interface has *English*, *Russian* and *Ukrainian* localizations, but there are more languages that user can choose for the names of the regions. 
In addition to the above languages, region names can also be displayed in *Spanish* and *Chinese (Mandarin)*.  
There is also an option of adding custom region names, which can be used as an extra localization.
